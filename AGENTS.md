<!-- KIT:START v1.0.0-74-g1c4fe71 — managed by mjs-project-template; edit below the KIT:END marker -->
## Agent Context & Protocols

This section is **managed by the kit** (`install-kit.sh`) — it is identical across repos. Put repo-specific context **below the `KIT:END` marker**; do not edit here.

### Session continuity

- Before starting, read the `▶ Resume here` block at the top of `TODO.md` (committed, so it syncs across machines) and recent `git log`. That is where the last session left off — repeating finished work is the most common avoidable mistake.
- Commit a chunk of work with `/session-commit`: commits code + `TODO.md`, appends a journal entry to `private/project_log.md` (the log is never committed).
- Run `/pstatus` often (after every `/session-commit`): it ranks open work and recommends the next step.
- End a session with `/wrap`: commits anything outstanding, refreshes the `▶ Resume here` pointer, and reports whether it is safe to shut down the editor.

### Priorities — GitHub labels are the source of truth

Priority labels are mutually exclusive and mean:

- `P0` — **Broken. Stop all work and fix it.** (production down / blocked / security breach)
- `P1` — **Delivers value to the mission.**
- `P2` — **Nice to have.**
- `deferred` — consciously postponed; `needs-triage` — awaiting a priority decision.

Then:

- Security comes first. Scanner alerts (Dependabot / code-scanning / GitGuardian) become issues labeled `security` + a graded priority: critical/high → `P0`, medium → `P1`, low → `P2`.
- `TODO.md` = a `▶ Resume here` block (maintained by `/wrap`) on top, then priority bands that `/pstatus` regenerates from the labels. Do not hand-edit the bands.
- The two halves have one writer each and a deliberate handover: `/wrap` writes the resume pointer at session end, `/context` reads it at session open, and the first `/pstatus` of the session **removes** it — by then you have already resumed, so it has served its purpose. A bands-only `TODO.md` mid-session is expected, not a loss.
- Kit files are overwritten wholesale on every sync — `.claude/commands/*.md`, `utility/sync-labels.sh`, `.markdownlint.jsonc`. Never add a rule to one of them: it is destroyed at the next sync (the installer now warns, but the rule still goes). A **generic** rule belongs upstream in [mjs-project-template](https://github.com/jwilleke/mjs-project-template) so every repo gets it. A **repo-specific** note about a command — a package manager the kit does not name, a scanner only this repo has — goes in `.claude/commands/<command>.local.md`, which the kit never writes, reads, or deletes. Read that file, if present, as part of the command; commit it, so it travels with the repo.
- `TODO.md` holds **no history** — only what is open right now. Never add "merged since last run", closed/merged counts, a session narrative, a dated changelog, or work from other repos. A closed item just stops appearing; that disappearance is the whole record. Session history goes in `private/project_log.md` via `/session-commit` and `/wrap`, and nowhere else.

### Working agreement

- Think before coding: state assumptions, surface trade-offs, ask when scope is ambiguous.
- Simplicity first: the minimum that solves the problem; nothing speculative.
- Use Conventional Commits for messages.
- Issue decomposition — NEVER put "Steps", "Phases", or numbered sequences inside a single GitHub issue. Break each step into its own issue and link them using GitHub relationships: `closes #N` / `fixes #N` (resolves another), `blocked by #N` (dependency), `relates to #N` (context link). Example: a 3-phase migration = 3 issues with "blocked by" chains, not one issue with Phase headings.
- Issue/PR links — Never use a bare `#N` reference alone. Always pair it with the full GitHub URL: `[#333](https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/333)`. This applies in commit messages, PR descriptions, comments, and any agent output. Use `/issues/N` for issues and `/pull/N` for PRs.
- Awaiting approval — When work is complete but requires human sign-off before closing, apply the `in-review` label and leave a comment on the issue/PR that states: what was done, what the human needs to verify, and what action closes it. Never self-close an issue or PR.
- Closing issues — **Always remove the `in-review` label when closing** an issue or PR (`gh issue edit N --remove-label in-review` before or with the close). Closed items must not keep `in-review`, or the label stops meaning "awaiting a decision" and the queue it drives can no longer be trusted.
- Commits — always use the `/session-commit` skill. Never run a bare `git commit` directly. `/session-commit` enforces the session log update, conventional commit format, and co-author trailer.
- Direct commits by default — commit to the default branch; do not open a pull request unless someone other than you will actually look at it before it lands. On a single-maintainer repo a self-opened, self-merged PR reviews nothing: it just splits one explanation across a commit message and a near-identical PR body. Put the reasoning in the commit message. A change touching a "risky" path, closing an issue, or feeling significant is **not** a reason to open one — CI runs on `push` as well as `pull_request`, so a direct commit is still tested. Where a PR does exist, its body points at the commit message rather than restating it.

### Markdown conventions

- Dash (`-`) bullets; no bare numbered lists. ATX (`#`) headings. Spaced tables (`| a | b |`).
- Inline HTML is **not** allowed. Long lines are fine.
- Rules live in `.markdownlint.jsonc`; the editor, CLI, CI and agents all read that one file.

## yourphr-ts-spike

### Project Context

A spike, not a product. It exists to answer one question for [jwilleke/yourphr](https://github.com/jwilleke/yourphr): can a TypeScript/Node FHIR store replace the Go backend? The decision and its stop rule live in that repo — `docs/planning/strategy-typescript-transition.md` ([#539](https://github.com/jwilleke/yourphr/issues/539)), and the architecture this code follows is `docs/planning/architecture-principles-typescript.md`.

Nothing here ships to a user. Prefer proving something and writing down the number over building something that works.

### Two hard rules

**Real patient records live in `./phi` and must never enter git history.** A leak is irreversible and a privacy breach. `.gitignore` is not the control — `git add -f` walks past it — so `scripts/check-no-phi.sh` runs as a pre-commit hook and in CI. Never commit `.db`, `.ndjson`, anything under `phi/`, or a file carrying FHIR patient fields. Never use `git add -A` here without looking at what it staged.

**All outbound network access goes through `src/http`.** That is where the SSRF guard lives, and it is worth exactly nothing if another file can import `node:https` or call `fetch()` directly — Node's built-in fetch is undici, which ignores `http.Agent` and therefore ignores the guarded DNS lookup that is the actual control. `scripts/check-http-boundary.sh` fails the build when anything else opens a path to the network.

### Commands

| Command | What it does | Needs real records |
|---|---|---|
| `npm run typecheck` | types | no |
| `npm run ssrf` | SSRF guard suite, 47 checks | no |
| `npm run check:boundary` | network access confined to `src/http` | no |
| `npm run check:phi` | no patient data in tracked files | no |
| `npm run load -- --in <ndjson> --db <db>` | load a corpus through `SqliteFhirRepository` | yes |
| `npm run diff` / `writes` / `isolation` / `http` | the comparison harnesses | yes |

Only the first four run in CI, because CI must never see PHI. The rest run on the operator's machine.

### What is proven so far

Measured against a real 19,796-resource export, not fixtures: generic indexing in 551 lines against 18,518 generated Go lines; 0 identity collisions across 8 sources; 71/71 queries matching Medplum's reference repository; 29/29 resource types matching production id for id; 11/11 on the write path; 6/6 on per-user isolation; 9/9 on the frontend HTTP contract.

**Sync is the untested one**, and it is the phase the whole decision turns on.

### Conventions

A guard nobody has tried to defeat is not known to work. Every check here was verified by breaking the thing it protects and confirming it goes red — do the same for anything new.
