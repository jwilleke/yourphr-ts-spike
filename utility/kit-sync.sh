# anything in here is an ordinary `overwrite` file that the sync itself delivers.

# That distinction is not theoretical. Every defect this mechanism has produced
# was in the logic, never in the trigger:
#
#   red on every push where Actions may not open PRs   logic
#   `git add -A` staging the kit checkout              logic
#   pushing a workflow file the token may not touch    logic
#   a pathspec fighting its own .gitignore             logic
#
# Each cost a manual round across the fleet. Held here, the next one does not.

# Usage: kit-sync.sh <kit-checkout-dir>
